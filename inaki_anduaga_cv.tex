\section{About me}

  \textbf{Driving change. At maximum speed. With uncompromising quality.} A relentless passion for improving engineering processes, crafting top-notch code and building scalable solutions is
  what keeps me late at night, reading about new technologies, or prototyping solutions that can increase development performance. The end objective is simple: Give the organization a competitive advantage to move
  faster than the competition, creating an engineering culture and processes that go beyond any single engineer and establish a foundation for continued, sustainable growth. \\

  I've been solving problems for the past twenty years, first as a physicist fascinated by the mathematical beauty and complexity of nature's laws, and nowadays as a software
  engineer working on more practical challenges, always aspiring for the most efficient and clean solution. Although different problems require different tools, the underlying thinking
  is usually the same, namely consistent logic, big-picture analysis, generalization of specific solutions, and looking at edge cases, whether solving a
  differential equation or designing a new library. These are the concepts I work hard to excel at.
