\section{About me}

\textbf{Driving change. At maximum speed. With uncompromising quality.} A relentless passion for improving processes, crafting top-notch, scalable solutions is
what keeps me late at night, reading about the newest technical possibilities, or thinking about ways to make my teams perform better. The end objective is simple: Give my clients a competitive advantage to move
faster than the competition, delivering not just products, but an engineering culture with processes that establish a foundation for continued, sustainable growth. \\

I've been solving problems for the past twenty years, first as a physicist fascinated by the mathematical beauty and complexity of nature's laws, and nowadays as a director of technology
working on more practical challenges, always aspiring for efficient, pragmatic solutions. Although different problems require different tools, the underlying thinking
is usually the same, namely consistent logic, big-picture analysis, generalization of specific solutions, and looking at edge cases, whether solving a
differential equation or finding a shortcut to deliver a product faster. These are the concepts I work hard to excel at.
