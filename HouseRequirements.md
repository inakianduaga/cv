Objective:

Pre-plan (vorplannung) to:

- Price-compare on a fixed design
- Does it make sense (use of space upstairs) to design the house with 3 floors instead of 2
- Are there requirements on how high you can build on top? (determine the angle or if there is a max angle)

If we can only fit one bathroom and 1 room that is super long then it wouldn't be worth to spend the money on a 3rd floor

Idea:
Keep private bedroom life separate from living life (1st floor). In the long version of the house we probably need to have bedrooms on the first floor as well

Total number of bedrooms in house: 6 (ideally fit the 6 in the 2 top floors). Some might depend on kneestock:
  - Possibility 1: 3 bedrooms on top floor + bathroom + 3 second floor
  - Possibility 2: 2 bedrooms on top (if tight space) + 4 on second floor

Bathroom: Every floor a bathroom (4 total).
  - 1 with a bathtub full (bathtub but don't need a shower). Also a double sink there
  - 3 just a shower (basement doesn't need a shower but ideally has the space for it)

Main (erdgeschoss):
  - Open kitchen living room eating space (at least 40sqm, 45+)
  - Home office: Big enough to serve as a guest room
  - Extra kitchen storage space (maybe kitchen doesn't need to be huge)
  - Accesible disability (potentially transform home office to a room an elderly can live). Shower needs to be wide enough to push someone in

Basement: needs to be heated & finished
  - Home office room (could also be converted into a bedroom). Think about light situation
  - Hobby raum (Playroom) that can be converted to a home entertainment room (ping pong table)
  - Machine room
  - Storage room
  - Bathroom (w/ a toilet)

Dimensions:

- 14 meters wide x 50m
- 8m wide by 16 wide supposedly (for sure 15m)

Windows:

- Fancy slide windows: out (too expensive)
- Windows around corner: out (too expensive)
- Windows longer than 3m: out (too expensive)
- Windows looking to the garden would be nice

Question:

- Money; What's more expensive to build: 3 story or 2 story
- If by law we have to cramp a lot in the 3rd floor, does it make sense to go as long as we can?
- For the long version, does it make sense to move one of the bedrooms or two on the first floor or the basement?
